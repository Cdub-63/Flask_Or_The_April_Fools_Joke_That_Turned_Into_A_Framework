# Accounts with Flask - Dinner Party

Accounts are the end result of gathering data necessary to create a user for a website. They also allow you to keep logging in to use the application.

Ever wonder what the process would be to create a site that featured user accounts? Well wonder no further! 

We will be using Flask’s Flask-Login, SQLAlchemy and WTForms Python packages to build our application. The application will allow you to invite your friends to a dinner party, and users will have the power to login and RSVP for the fun evening. We’ll call it *drumroll*\ : DinnerParty! The sooner we start, the sooner us and our friends will be enjoying dessert!
